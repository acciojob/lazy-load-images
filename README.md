# Lazy Load Images

You are building a web page that contains a large number of images. To improve the page's performance, you decide to implement lazy loading of images so that they only load when they are in the viewport. Write a JavaScript function that detects when an image is in the viewport and asynchronously loads it.

## Instructions

1. Basic boilerplate is already given to you with CSS and HTML.
2. You just have to modify the `script.js` file
3. Whenever image is loaded on screen, change the `data-loaded` attribute to `true` in each img tag. Also remove the class `lazy`
